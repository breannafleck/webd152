   <p>I typically just drink water but if I'm going to enjoy a beverage, it will probably be one containing alcohol. My go-to beverage when drinking alcohol would be a Hazy IPA, especially the ones brewed by Harland Brewery. Hazy IPA's are citrusy, slightly hoppy and cloudy. They are refreshing and I enjoy sipping on them whilst soaking up some sun.</p>
